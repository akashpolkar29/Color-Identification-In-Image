# Color-Identification-In-Image
This project focuses on the detection and identification of specific colors in images using computer vision techniques. The goal is to analyze an image and classify different color regions, enabling the system to highlight and distinguish various colors in real-time.

### Features
Automatic Color Detection: Identify and extract prominent colors in any image, even if they are present in small areas.
<br>
Color Code Representation: Display colors in RGB and HEX formats for easy integration with digital applications.
<br>
Color Naming: Match detected colors to a known database to provide names (e.g., “Sky Blue,” “Crimson”) for easy reference.
<br>
Customizable Thresholds: Fine-tune the color detection thresholds to adapt to different image qualities and lighting conditions.
<br>
### How It Works
Image Preprocessing: The image is loaded and converted to a color space suitable for analysis, typically RGB.
<br>
Color Detection: Colors in the image are analyzed pixel by pixel or by regions to identify distinct color clusters.
<br>
Color Matching: Each detected color is compared to a predefined set of colors to find the closest match, assigning names where applicable.
<br>
Output: The program generates a report or visualization showing each color’s RGB and HEX values along with the common name.
### Applications
<br>
Digital Design and Art: Helps designers identify and use color schemes from images.
<br>
Brand Analysis: Analyze brand colors in images for consistency in digital marketing.
<br>
Educational Tools: Serve as a teaching aid in color theory and color recognition.
<br>
### Technologies Used:
1. Python
<br>
2. OpenCV 
<br>
3. NumPy 
<br>
4. Pandas 
<br>
5. Color Database: A CSV file with predefined colors and their RGB/HEX values.
